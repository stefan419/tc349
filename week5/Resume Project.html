<H1>Resume Website:</H1>
<p>I want to produce a clean, efficient, and informative website that covers my life, skills, and creative ability.  Details: My Photos, my Designs, My art, skills, life experiences, professional experiences, Education, Videos, values, Projects, accomplishments,</p>


<h2>STEFAN PETRMICHL outline
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
Hopefully has a slider like on amazon on steampowered.com
	Pictures with “About me,” “Art and the Like,”  and “Professional”
<ul>
<li>About me:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Life experiences</li>
    <li>Values</li>
    <li>Hobbies</li>
</ul>

<li>Art and the Like:</li>
<ul>
	<li>My best photos</li>
	<li>Best art</li>
	<li>Edited video</li>
</ul>
<li>Professional:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Skills</li>
	<li>Professional experiences</li>
	<li>Eductation</li>
	<li>Projects</li>
	<li>Accomplishments</li>
   </ul>
</ul>
</ul>
This was a relatively straight forward outline to create, my subjects only disagreed on where to put a few things.  Values and Skills would fit in either "about me" or "professional."  I think it'll only be 3 main subject pages, but they contain all the things listed underneath them.
